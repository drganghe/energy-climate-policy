That paper was published in 2010, now more than a decade has past and let’s update the Rosenfeld Plant to 2021.\nTo define a Rosenfeld Plant, you would need to figure out the average size of U.S. coal plants, the average capacity factor of those operating plants, average emission factor of coal power plants, and the average transmissin losses. You may able to find those statistics on the web, however, I hope you can use plant level data to calculate those by yourself."

(1pt) [Hint: use total plant annual net generation and total plant annual heat input to calculate the average efficiency]\n\nIf we can improve the average efficiency of coal plants by 1% (percentage point), e.g. 32% to 33%, how many new Rosenfeld Plant we can avoid building? [Hint: use the same total coal generation] (1.5pt)\n\nFurther explore the data, what are the top 10 carbon emitting plants in the U.S. and think about how to reduce carbon emissions for those plants (1.5 pt)\n\nNote: please show your process to receive partial credit.\nPlug: eGRID has rich resources and we will come back to this assignment when discuss environmental and climate justice."

    "text": "Water withdrawal vs. water consumption\n\nWithdrawal is the volume of water removed from a source\n\nConsumption is the volume of water withdrawn that is not returned to the source, i.e. it is evaporated or transported to another location. \nDischarge is the volume of water withdrawn that is returned to the source, often degraded by use (altered physically or chemically) and impacting water quality. \nWater withdrawals are, by definition, always greater than or equal to consumption and are, therefore, the first limit approached at an energy production facility when water availability is constrained. \nConsumptive use reduces the amount of water available to satisfy demands downstream and is an important consideration where water resources are strained to meet the needs of all users."

Assume you are the project manager for an offshore wind developer preparing to bid in New York’s 2024 offshore wind solicitation. Use your energy analysis skills to prepare your bid and evaluate the viability of your project.\nQuestions:\n\nEstimate Capacity Factor Using Average Wind Speed\n\nResources are key for project success. The average wind speed at the solicitation site is 8.18m/s, and the turbines can achieve their rated power output at a wind speed of 12m/s. Can you estimate the capacity factor of this site? (0.5pt)\n\n\nCalculate Capacity Factor Using Hourly Wind Speed Data\n\nDownload the hourly wind speed for the solicitation site using Renewables Ninja. Use the longitude and lattitude of the site to obtain the data.\nCompute the annual average capacity factor using the hourly wind speed or simulated hourly capacity factor from the data.(0.5pt)\n\n\nEstimate the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) for Your Project\n\nYour CEO needs to understand the project’s LCOE to make an investment decision. As a reference, the 2.5 GW Empire Wind Offshore and Beacon Wind projects secured a power purchase agreement (PPA) at $80.40/MWh. Assume your company plans to bid for a 2GW capacity project.\nBased on this information, estimate the LCOE of your proposed project. Make reasonable assumptions and determine if it makes sense for your company to bid. What price should you offer? (1pt)\nKey information to consider:\n\nCapital costs (find comparable reports from recent offshore wind projects)\n\nOperating costs: 3% of capital costs\nDiscount rate: 4%\n\nCapacity factor: from earlier questions\n\n\nImpact of a High Inflation Rate\n\nAssume the discount rate is raised from 4% to 7% due to inflation, check how this will impact your results and releate it to the news of why companies drop their bids2.

    "text": "Water withdrawal vs. water consumption\n\nWithdrawal is the volume of water removed from a source\n\nConsumption is the volume of water withdrawn that is not returned to the source, i.e. it is evaporated or transported to another location. \nDischarge is the volume of water withdrawn that is returned to the source, often degraded by use (altered physically or chemically) and impacting water quality. \nWater withdrawals are, by definition, always greater than or equal to consumption and are, therefore, the first limit approached at an energy production facility when water availability is constrained. \nConsumptive use reduces the amount of water available to satisfy demands downstream and is an important consideration where water resources are strained to meet the needs of all users."

(0.5pt)\n\n\nList the top 10 countries based on their total annual carbon emissions from energy related activities.\n\n\nTop 10 countries by per capita average carbon emissions? (0.5pt)\n\n\nList the top 10 countries based on their average carbon emissions per capita. How does this differ from total emissions rankings?\n\n\nTop 5 countries with the highest and lowest carbon intensity (carbon emission/GDP), respectively? Offer your assumptions why this is the case, use data to show your assumptions if possible. (1pt)\n\n\nList the top 5 countries with the highest carbon intensity (carbon emission/GDP) and the top 5 countries with the lowest carbon intensity (carbon emission/GDP).\nProvide a brief explanation for the observed trends in carbon intensity.\nUse data visualizations to support your analysis, such as line charts or bar graphs, to show how carbon intensity has changed over time for the selected countries.\nConsider factors such as changes in energy sources, energy efficiency, and economic structure that may contribute to the observed patterns in carbon intensity.\nDiscuss the implications of these trends for climate change mitigation and the role of different countries in addressing global emissions.\n\n\nTop 10 countries by cumulative carbon emissions (1750-2022)? (0.5pt)\n\n\nList the top 10 countries based on their cumulative carbon emissions since 1750. How does historical responsibility for emissions compare to current emissions?\n\n\nList all countries that have peaked their carbon emissions and specify the year they peaked? (1pt)\n\n\nHighlight notable trends or strategies that may have contributed to these peaks and declines.\n\n\nProduction-based vs. consumption-based accounting: ranking changes? (0.5pt)\n\n\nExplore how the rankings of carbon emissions change when switching from production-based accounting (emissions generated within a country) to consumption-based accounting (emissions associated with goods consumed in a country, regardless of where they were produced).\nExplain the key drivers behind these ranking changes and what they reveal about global trade and emissions responsibility.\n\n\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global carbon emissions? (0.5pt)\n\n\nUsing global data, describe the impact the pandemic had on carbon emissions.\nUse readings to explain how different factors, such as economic slowdown, reduced transportation, and shifts in energy demand, contributed to these changes.\n\n\nTechnology and methods for near real-time carbon monitoring (0.5pt)\n\n\nDiscuss the technologies and methods that enable near real-time carbon monitoring, such as satellite data, machine learning, and ground-based sensors.\nProvide one example of how daily carbon emissions data could improve policy discussions or lead to actionable climate solutions.\n\nNote: For each question, list the countries and their corresponding data. As we progress through the course, we will revisit this assignment when discussing the principle of “common but differentiated responsibilities” in climate negotiations and governance."

Read more on coal phase out here. You can download historical coal consumption data for any country from Our Wold in Data. Please note that the unit is in TWh ranther than traditional tons.\n\n\nQuestions\n\nDelayed UK coal phase-out: If the UK delayed its coal phase out by six years, how much additional coal would consume, and how much more carbon emissions would this result in? Assume starting 2023 (UK Energy Act), a linear declince to zero coal consuption by 2030, instead of 2024. Use an emission factor of 91.2tCO2/TJ, and 1TWh = 3600 TJ (1.5pts)\nCoal phase-out in other countries: Choose a country of interest (e.g. the U.S., China, Chile) and apply a similar analysis to show the benefits of an earlier coal phase out. For example, what if China phases out coal by 2040 instead of 2050. (1pt)"

This graduate-level course provides a systems approach to understanding the essential policy questions and analytic tools necessary to achieve the energy transition required to address climate change. Over the course of the semester, we will cover a broad range of topics, including an overview of the energy and climate landscape, project economics, energy sources and technologies, energy demand, environmental and health impacts, power system analysis, energy transition strategies, energy efficiency, sustainable consumption, climate justice, big data and AI for climate change, and the limitations of models. We will also explore emerging topics relevant to energy systems and achieving carbon neutrality. Through a combination of lectures, case studies, and real-world assignments, students will gain a comprehensive understanding of the essentials of energy and climate policy. We aim to provide students with a nuanced understanding of the energy transition landscape and prepare them to make a meaningful impact in shaping the policy frameworks that will drive the transition towards a sustainable future."
