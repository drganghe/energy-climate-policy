## Introduction

Your final project is a demonstration of your master of the concepts and skills discussed in the class. You can choose an energy related topic of your own interest. In each lecture, I listed sample analytic questions of the chapter and I hope that offers you some inspiration. I also post below sample topics.

### Sample policy memo topics

- What would be an opitimal congestion price in NYC?
- Policies to enhance supply chains of offshore wind in NYS?
- What NYSERDA should do to promote heat pump installations?
- How to help disadvantaged communities to adapt climate change?
