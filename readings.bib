  abstract = {Meeting the Paris Agreement’s climate targets necessitates better knowledge about which climate policies work in reducing emissions at the necessary scale. We provide a global, systematic ex post evaluation to identify policy combinations that have led to large emission reductions out of 1500 climate policies implemented between 1998 and 2022 across 41 countries from six continents. Our approach integrates a comprehensive climate policy database with a machine learning–based extension of the common difference-in-differences approach. We identified 63 successful policy interventions with total emission reductions between 0.6 billion and 1.8 billion metric tonnes CO2. Our insights on effective but rarely studied policy combinations highlight the important role of price-based instruments in well-designed policy mixes and the policy efforts necessary for closing the emissions gap.},

Building on existing evidence that focuses on climate–ageing, ageing–health and health–climate connections, this Review summarizes ageing trends and the biophysical, socio-demographic, cultural and contextual pathways that shape the disproportionate impacts of climate-related environmental stress on older adults’ health. We propose a framework to conceptualize how these many factors intersect with climate stressors to impact the health of older adults. We also discuss knowledge gaps and suggest ways to improve social and health science research and data infrastructure. Older adults are more likely to have health conditions that increase their vulnerability to climate stressors. This Review introduces a framework to conceptualize how biophysical, socio-demographic, cultural and contextual factors intersect with climate stressors to impact the health of older adults.},

Although growing literature has reported green job opportunities (e.g., solar technicians) as a potential solution to the displacement of coal sector workers, the extent to which green jobs are easily accessible, regarding co-location and skill requirements, remains unclear. Here, we explore this issue in the context of China’s coal phaseout toward the 2060 carbon neutrality target. Using a coal power plant retirement model of 3,765 coal power units, we find that coal power plant workers must travel long distances (178–242~km) to reach a green job site. When further considering job skill qualifications, in total, fewer than 15\% of these workers can easily access green jobs. Postponing the coal phaseout might further exacerbate the job transition challenge. Upstream industries of the renewable energy sector (e.g., electrical machinery), which can be located closer to coal power plants and have better job skill matching, can help alleviate the challenging prospect.},

The new edition significantly deepened my understanding of what nudges are and how they can be employed. It truly is a must-read.\&quot;―Robert Cialdini, New York Times bestselling author of Influence    \&quot;Few books can be said to have changed the world, but Nudge did. The Final Edition is marvelous: funny, useful, and wise.\&quot;―Daniel Kahneman, \#1 New York Times bestselling author of Thinking, Fast and Slow    Since the original publication of Nudge more than a decade ago, the word \&quot;nudge\&quot; has entered the vocabulary of businesspeople, policymakers, engaged citizens, and consumers everywhere. The book has given rise to more than 200 \&quot;nudge units\&quot; in governments around the world and countless groups of behavioral scientists in every part of the economy. It has taught us how to use thoughtful \&quot;choice architecture\&quot;--a concept the authors invented--to help us make better decisions for ourselves, our families, and our society.    Now, the authors have rewritten the book from cover to cover, making use of their experiences in and out of government over the past dozen years as well as the explosion of new research in numerous academic disciplines. It offers a wealth of new insights, for both its avowed fans and newcomers to the field, about a wide variety of issues that we face in our daily lives--COVID-19, health, personal finance, retirement savings, credit card debt, home mortgages, medical care, organ donation, climate change, and \&quot;sludge\&quot; (paperwork and other nuisances that we don\&\#39;t want and keep us from getting what we do want)--all while honoring one of the cardinal rules of nudging: make it fun!},

abstract={Technology hardware and deployment processes (`soft technology') seem fundamentally different, but little work examines the nature of this difference and its implications for technology improvement. Here we present a model to study the roles of hardware and soft technology in cost evolution and apply it to solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. Differing properties of hardware and soft technology help explain PV's cost decline. Rapid improvements in hardware affected globally traded components that lowered both hardware and soft costs. Improvements in soft technology occurred more slowly, were not shared as readily across locations and only affected soft costs, ultimately contributing less than previously estimated. As a result, initial differences in soft technology across countries persisted and the share of soft costs rose. In general, we show the usefulness of modelling dependencies between technology costs and features to understand past drivers of cost change and inform future technology development.},

	abstract = {The costs for solar photovoltaics, wind, and battery storage have dropped markedly since 2010, however, many recent studies and reports around the world have not adequately captured such dramatic decrease. Those costs are projected to decline further in the near future, bringing new prospects for the widespread penetration of renewables and extensive power-sector decarbonization that previous policy discussions did not fully consider. Here we show if cost trends for renewables continue, 62\% of China’s electricity could come from non-fossil sources by 2030 at a cost that is 11\% lower than achieved through a business-as-usual approach. Further, China’s power sector could cut half of its 2015 carbon emissions at a cost about 6\% lower compared to business-as-usual conditions.},
