## Sample analytic questions

-   How do I know if I should trust modeling results?\
-   What are the methods to address uncertainties?\
-   What are the emerging topics to improve modeling analysis?\
-   How to interpret modeling results to communicate effectively?\
-   Where to use model? How to build your analysis?

## Conditions for model robustness

Models can be accurate when they describe systems that  

- are observable and measurable  
- exhibit constancy of structure over time  
- exhibit constancy across variations in conditions not specified in the model  
- permit the collection of ample data

## Social economic structural changes

- Core data and assumptions, which drive results, are based on historical experiences, which can be off if structural conditions change  
- The exact timing and character of pivotal events and technology changes is unpredictable

- Price the priceless  


## Better modeling uncertainties {.smaller}

- Define an endpoint of analysis  
- List all uncertain parameters  
- Specify maximum range of values  
- Specify subjective probability distribution for values within the range  
- Determin and account for correlations  
- Probability distribution of model predictions  
- Derive quantitative uncertainties 
- Obtain additional data and repeat analysis if needed

- Results does not automatically translate to policies  
- Communicating the limitations and uncertainties  


## Open source 

- Open model (code)  
- Open data  
- Open results  
- Open validation  

In Open we Trust!

## Energy vs power
::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Energy is the ability to do work. Energy is power integrated over **time**.

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Power is the **rate** at which work is done, or energy is transmitted.
- Basic unit: watt = jourle/second

## Energy demand

- Energy demand is shaped by dynamic factors: populations, GDP, technology, regulation, and human behavior   
- Understanding those drivers will help us learn the magnitude and profile of our demand  
- Load forecast integrates all insights to the show   


## Energy efficiency

-   There are barriers for energy efficiency and inforamtion and standards can help address the energy efficiency gap\
-   Human behavior is complicated, and understanding it will help us to design policy\
-   Rebound is real but might be overplayed, rebound could be good if improve welfare\
-   Sustainable consumption and production within the limit


## Energy access and energy justice

-   Electricity/energy access is fundamental to other modern services: education, health, and information\
-   Energy access also has gender equity, health cobenefits, and other implications\
-   Energy justice is important to achieve just transition\
-   An reflection on our approaches to energy justice


## Energy, environment, and human health

-   Environmental and health impacts are the externalities of energy systems\
-   Energy-air-pollution-human health framework of analysis\
-   Energy-water-carbon nexus\
-   System impacts show the constraint in systems modeling


## Energy transition

-   Diverse factors that drive energy transition\
-   Common and differentiated solutions to energy\
-   Leverage the advantages\
-   Addressing uncertainties: geopolitics, wars, pandemic, and more


## Power sector decarbonization

-   Power sector's central role in decarbonization\
-   Capacity expansion model to analyze the optimized investment decisions\
-   Decisions in the real world is much more complicated\
-   Emerging trends in the power sector


## Big data and AI

-   AI and big data has transformed how we live, and how can we save the planet\
-   AI does not automatic add new insights, but it provides powerful tools to analyze increasingly available big data\
-   Learning those new tools and skills becomes necessary to work in the field\
-   The potential of using AI/big data to analyze our understanding of energy supply/demand and human behavior is enomorous. 


## Uncertainies and limitation

-   Know the limitation of models\
-   Use model appropriately\
-   Interpret/communicate the results effectively\
-   Models for social good
