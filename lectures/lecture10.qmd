## Sample analytic questions

-   What are the environmental impacts of a fossil power plant?  
-   How much water could you save if you replace all water cooling plants with air cooling?  
-   What are the human health impacts of energy?  
-   How climate change affect human health?  
-   What are the co-benefits of energy transitions?

## Water withdrawal vs. water consumption{.smaller}

- Withdrawal is the volume of water removed from a source\
- Consumption is the volume of water withdrawn that is not returned to the source, i.e. it is evaporated or transported to another location.\ 
- Discharge is the volume of water withdrawn that is returned to the source, often degraded by use (altered physically or chemically) and impacting water quality.\ 
- Water withdrawals are, by definition, always greater than or equal to consumption and are, therefore, the first limit approached at an energy production facility when water availability is constrained.\ 
- Consumptive use reduces the amount of water available to satisfy demands downstream and is an important consideration where water resources are strained to meet the needs of all users.

-   Energy-air pollution/climate change-human health framework of analysis\
-   Energy-water-carbon nexus\
-   System impacts show the constraint in systems modeling
